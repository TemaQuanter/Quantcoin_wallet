# Quantcoin wallet
This is an original wallet for the blockchain of [Quantcoin](http://tehnoquant.com/quantcoin/).

## Installation

Quantcoin wallet requires [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.8+ to run.

After the installation of python 3, go to the project folder, open cmd on Windows, terminal on Mac os and Linux.

Run the following command:

#### On Windows

```sh
python wallet.py
```

#### On Mac os and Linux

```sh
python3 wallet.py
```

If you open the wallet for the first time, it might take a lot of time to download all the blocks from the Quantcoin blockchain and generate a private key for your account.

Then you will see the UI of Quantcoin wallet.

##### WARNING:
Always see what happens in the cmd or terminal while using this wallet! Although the wallet has a UI, cmd or terminal remains the primary source of information.
If you see that cmd or terminal requires some actions from you directly in it, please follow the instructions.
